# Thomas Pickell - Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for the personal portfolio website of Thomas Pickell, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student. This was a side project meant to introduce me to basic but still useful web design tools

## Development Choices & Technologies Used

The goal for this website was to create a professional, fast, and easy-to-maintain portfolio without the overhead of complex frameworks.

  * **HTML5:** The site is built with semantic HTML5 for a clear and accessible structure.

  * **Tailwind CSS:** Instead of writing custom CSS, this project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) via a CDN. This framework was chosen to enable rapid UI development and ensure a consistent design system directly within the HTML. It allows for building custom designs without leaving the markup.

  * **Vanilla JavaScript:** For interactivity, dependency-free JavaScript is used. A heavy front-end framework like React or Vue was intentionally avoided to keep the website fast, lightweight, and simple to deploy.

  * **Remix Icon:** All icons on the website are from [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/), a set of open-source neutral-style system symbols for beautiful and consistent iconography.
